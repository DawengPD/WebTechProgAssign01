    <h3> <p>Cinnamon delivers an altogether different side of paradise with our Yala wildlife resort – Cinnamon Wild Yala.
      <br>The rustic resort is located 335km from the airport and sits on the border of the Yala National Park,
      <br>complete with a tribe of resident grey lemurs who might just think it fun to jump on your roof in the wee hours of the morning!</p>
<p>The road leading to the hotel is a narrow, dusty one, bordering the massive lake with crocodile, pelican and deer that live in perfect harmony with the hotel.
  <br>Cinnamon Wild Yala’s strategic location also means that an elephant, wild boar and other feral friends come regularly to visit us from the park next door
  <br>- and if you’re really lucky, a leopard may pass you by.
  <br>Stand still, hold your breath and feel your heart pound in your chest.
  <br>For the lover of the wilderness, the symbiosis of resort and wild will make you feel right at home and give you that rush of adrenalin you’re looking for.</p> </h3>
